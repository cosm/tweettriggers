An app is defined by three URLs:
 - /setup                 :  used for initial trigger creation
 - /configure/:trigger_id  :  used to configure / reconfigure the trigger
 - /trigger/:trigger_id   :  used to send the actual trigger to
 
The first two of these URLs are the only ones used in the interface.

When an interface URL (/setup or /configure) is loaded into an iFrame it must:

 - initially send an "init" message to the parent frame on load of any page
 - accept an "initted" message which passes it an id that it should store for future communications. It should not take further actions until it has received this message.
 - send a "ready" message with its id to declare that it is ready to accept user input
 - respond to a "save" message it must trigger its save method to save the state of the trigger and respond with "saved" once it has been saved, passing back the trigger url as a parameter
 
This API is intentionally simple in order to provide enough flexibility whilst maintaining simplicity

This has all been wrapped up into a javascript module for further simplicity
